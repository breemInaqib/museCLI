# museCLI

museCLI is an early-stage python command-line project exploring calm, clarity-first workflows for coding and reflection.

the long-term idea is a natural language interface in the terminal that helps you capture thoughts, organise small bits of work, and experiment with ai-assisted commands without adding noise. right now, the repo is focused on design, structure, and a minimal foundation.

## direction (intended)
- capture notes and “moments” quickly from the terminal
- explore simple natural-language commands for small workflows (planned)
- organise and retrieve entries locally (planned)
- keep the interface lightweight, readable, and local-first where possible

**vision**  
to make your digital life lighter and more intentional, starting at the command line.

## status
early scaffold. not yet runnable. currently focused on design and planning.

## quickstart
not yet available. a runnable v0.1 will be added once the minimal core is implemented.

## contributing
issues and pull requests are welcome. feedback on scope, cli ergonomics, and “smallest useful v0.1” is especially helpful.

## licence
